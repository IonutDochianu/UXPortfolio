        As an aspiring UX Designer, I had to demonstrate my abilities in this
        project by working alone on a customer assignment. I had to go through
        the complete design process, resulting in a working high-fidelity
        prototype, to prove that I was a skilled designer who understood the
        fundamentals of creation. I had to apply everything I had learnt during
        my first year of UXD in order to do this.

        <h3>Introduction and my role</h3>
        <p>
          In our last semester of the first year we were all allowed to choose
          out first ever client to work for. I had been assigned to work for
          Happynizr. It is a website meant to help businesses with creating
          their own forms in order to receive feedback. Our job is to work on
          one of the 4 main problems the website presents: the website, the
          dashboard, the tool of creating surveys and the connection between the
          website and the tool. I have chosen to work on the tool. Since the
          goal of the company is to help business to not have any problem with
          their surveys they offer a platform for them to build them on, while
          helping them create and maintain them. The tool mainly focuses on
          creating surveys and of course all the settings that come with it, so
          exploring these problems to make an easier life for new users, but
          also for the employees of Happynizr is my main objective.
        </p>
        <h3>Documentation of the process and the creation</h3>
        <p>
          For documentation we started by having a big interview with the owner
          of the company. We had all done research and had been given a demo of
          the website to play with. After the interview another analyzing of the
          website has been done, which concluded to starting the preparation of
          the research metods and questions that would fit the need of the tool.
          As for participants I was lucky enough to be able to test with people
          studying business, therefore the future target audience. After a
          couple user testing, a competitor analysis was also done, and all the
          results were than placed and analyzed in a Journey map. After that the
          results and the design vision were carefully built and that is when
          the prototyping also started.
          <br />
          <br />
          I wanted to build a prototype that would be as close to the initial
          one, but which included all the necessary ideas for a better
          experience. I built a paper prototype first, which was then tested by
          my friends and family. After that I started building the wireframe and
          directly into the low-fidelity prototype. I had my classmates test
          those, and since most of them also knew the problems the website had I
          was easily able to start working on the high-fidelity prototype
          presented above.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          What I liked was the freedom we were given especially with the
          ideation techniques since I discovered so many ideation techniques
          throughout the whole process which I canâ€™t wait to one day use in my
          projects. But I am also happy that I got to use some techniques I have
          seen before in my projects for the first time (the 3-6-5 and Dark
          Side). I have also learned that some ideas which I had in the start,
          even without any research, are some of the ideas I ended up
          implementing, because even though I did not have any tests at the
          moment I had a feeling. And thinking back after I had my insights and
          design vision I was able to see them fitting perfectly in my design. I
          am very happy with the result of this project. I have learned a lot
          about the design process and how to work with clients. I have also
          learned a lot about the importance of documentation and how to analyze
          the results of the research.
