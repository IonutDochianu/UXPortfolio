        In this course we worked on design projects where we had to come up with
        solutions for specific interface component problems. There were various
        types, such as an interactive list and navigation menu. In order to
        select a design pattern that best matches the problem, we learned to
        first examine it using design principles.

        <h3>Introduction and my role</h3>
        <p>
          The design challenge of this project is to redesign the website of the
          client, the Dutch Store, in order to shift their brand perception &
          build their online presence. The Dutch Store is an online webstore
          that sells Dutch goods, mainly food, abroad in the USA. The website is
          outdated and needs to be improved for its clients who are mainly Dutch
          people who miss their culture and food while living abroad in the US.
          The goal of this project is to create a website design using relevant
          patterns to make a successful improved web shop of The Dutch Store. In
          this endavour I had to work paired with one of my classmates. The
          tasks were divided equally between us, but I was the one mostly in
          charge of diverging new ideas of redesigning the website. I also was
          the one that took care of the style guide, the recipe page, which has
          been a personal addition to the project, and the main product page,
          whcih can both be seen in the pictures above.
        </p>
        <h3>Design process</h3>
        <p>
          We were unable to have an interview with the owner of the website,
          therefore all our research was mainly based on the extensive persona
          presented to us and on the expert review that me and my colleague were
          able to do. We were able to go and test the website ourselves, and
          find the main things that we did not agree with or enjoyed in our
          experience surfing it. A lot of really old models, of unused buttons,
          unnecesarry information and badly ordered products. With the
          information we had, we were able to use the MOSCOW Method to
          prioritize the most important things we considered needed changing. We
          started building some of the assets that the website will have, and
          also constructing the wireframe which we were going to follow. After
          all the wireframes were built and the assets were discussed with our
          coach, we then proceeded into building what ended up being the
          high-fidelity prototype showcased in the pictures shown on the top.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          We had a list of patterns we knew we had to use to increase the
          efficiency and user flow of our website before we even began the
          design process. We discovered during the process that we instinctively
          include patterns without even realizing it, and we also adjusted some
          of our preexisting patterns because they no longer seemed to suit. We
          were able to critically evaluate our design and fix any issues we
          missed during the design phase with the assistance of the feedback
          sessions.
          <br /><br />
          We were able to pick up new talents and polish old ones thanks to this
          initiative. In particular, we delved further into interface design
          patterns and discovered how to build a system from scratch with key
          interaction patterns. At addition to providing a new shopping
          experience in the Dutch Store with a refreshed appearance throughout
          this project, we also wanted to include new elements like the recipe
          pages for a better experience.
