        During this project I had to develop my understanding of the layout of
        screen elements and grids in interface design, as well as how to
        effectively structure a website page to show and convey a story.

        <h3>Introduction and my role</h3>
        <p>
          This project was presented to us as an oportunitty to define our
          knowledge and abilites of using the layout and grids of a screen in
          order to build more effective interfaces and be able to play with the
          contents of a website page more easily. The project was presented to
          us as structuring a given fragment in multiple pages, using the best
          ways of structuring the content and the layout of the page.
        </p>
        <h3>The process</h3>
        <p>
          I started by building a really clean first page of the website, which
          later turned into a scrollable page to the 5 separated parts I had
          prepared for the fragment. I wanted to havea really simple design on
          the page to be able to see how I would play with the whole layout in
          different situations. It was my first time using the grid of the page
          to its full potential and making sure that every single detail is
          layed the right way. The escape hatch was the other thing my coach was
          really keen on having, and so I included the nice icon of the wave
          which is also present above.
        </p>
        <h3>The conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Using the grid and the page layout showed me what a really ordered and
          knowladgable individual can do even with only having to play with bits
          of text across a screen. I have also realised how used we are to
          having an escape hatch and that sometimes was completely out of the
          scope that I would have. I got so used to having one that I would not
          even consider having one on my own design, but with this experience I
          know that it really can build a much smoother and intuitive experience
          for any user.
